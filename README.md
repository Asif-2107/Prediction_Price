# Prediction_Price
In this project, I have performed a predictive analysis of house prices using machine learning methods like linear regression. The goal of the project was to develop a model that could accurately predict the price of a house based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and other relevant factors.

To accomplish this, I collected a dataset of house prices from various sources and used it to train a linear regression model. I then tested the model on a separate dataset to evaluate its accuracy and measure its performance using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared.

After fine-tuning the model, I achieved a high prediction score that indicates the model's effectiveness in predicting house prices. The results of the analysis can be used by real estate agents, property investors, and prospective homeowners to make informed decisions about buying or selling a house.

The project was implemented in Python using popular data science libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. The code is available along with the datasets used in the analysis and a detailed explanation of the methodology and results.
